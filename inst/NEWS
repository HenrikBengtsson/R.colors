Version: 0.1 [2003-11-20]
o Created with inspiration of old Colors class in R.graphics.
  One purpose of it was to get a foundation to easily generate
  graphs through different color filters. One such filter of 
  interest is the DichromatColorFilter (based on Thomas Lumley's
  package), which provides an easy way to check how color blind
  people perceives your graphs. This is especially important in
  red-green microarray analysis.
